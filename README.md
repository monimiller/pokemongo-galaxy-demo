This repository corresponds with the pokemon and mongo (get it?) demo done at Trino Summit 11/10.


## Pokemon(go) for the win

Hello fellow data friends. Welcome to this repository. The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase the benefits of using Trino to create a data lakehouse architecture within your data lake. We're using [Starburst Galaxy](https://galaxy.starburst.io/login) because it's the easiest way to try out Trino. What we will do is query data from MongoDB and S3, create a reporting structure within our data lake, and then create our Thoughtspot dashboard.
